# ETL_Mini_Project_22
Project 2 for data class

We were tasked with taking an ETL project and making our own queries to the starter files
In order to do that, we had to create csv files out of what we were given
Create sql and database with pgadmin
Took our database and ran queries through a jupyter notebook
After queries were made, we made visualizations for most of the queries to show the data in different ways
